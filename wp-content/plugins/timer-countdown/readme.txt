Countdown Timer is a 100% free and customizable plugin, which allows you to create countless countdown models that suit the style of your website.

== Description ==

The Countdown Timer Plugin is a 100% free and 100% customizable plugin, it will allow you to create different countdown models for your website. You can customize a number of parameters in order to make the plugin look exactly the way you want; you will also have the option of adding to the Timer the visual effect of circles in different versions.

The Countdown Timer plugin has 8 timer templates by default, so you can load and customize them at your will, you can also create your own template from scratch.

You must enter the target date and time and the Timer Countdown plugin will automatically calculate the remaining time and display it on the pages of your website that has the **[timer-countdown] shortcode**. You will be able to display the remaining time in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds; or any configuration you decide. The remaining time will be calculated taking into account the time of your Wordpress installation and not the local time of each connected user. In that way when the count reaches zero, it will reach zero for all users at the same time, regardless of where in the world they are.
